// flex items centering

The next use case is centering an item and this is something we all have struggled with before. Flexbox vertically centering items involved some sort of a hack and there was no clean solution. This has been made really simple with flexbox. So let's see how again I have empty HTML in the body and blank CSS file. In the HTML, I'm going to add a div tag with a container class. Within the container, I'm going to add another div tag with a class item. The text is also going to be item. Next, in the CSS file, I'm going to copy/paste some basic styling on the container class. We have a height of 400px, width of 400px and a border of 5px solid black. And on the item class, we have a height of 80px, width of 80px and a border 3px solid orange. Now if you take a look at the browser, you can see that the item is placed at the top left corner of the container. Now how do we place this exactly at the center. We can calculate the additional space divide that by 2 and then set the top and left properties. But flexbox however has a really simple solution on the container class. Just set display to flex, set justify-content to center and align-items to center as well. Now if I refresh, a perfectly centered item placed inside the container. So there you go centering an item in a container using flexbox.
